# Student Support System

The Student Support System is a software application developed for a company that aims to provide support to students with difficulties in Systems Analysis and Design, programming paradigms, programming logic, and basic mathematics. This system allows for the efficient management and control of student and teacher data, the organization of training groups, and the recording of payments for courses and sessions.

## Features

- **Student Data Management:** The system can handle basic student data, including name, surname, document number, place of residence, email, telephone number, date of birth, university, and the number of subjects taken in different semesters.

- **Teacher Information:** It manages information about teachers, including their name, document number, last name, city of residence, email, profession, year of starting at the university, and year of completion of their teaching work.

- **Group Creation:** The system allows for the creation of four groups, each corresponding to specific subjects for training. Teachers can be assigned to groups based on their specialty.
